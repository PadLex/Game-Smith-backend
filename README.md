Ludii is a general game system being developed as part of the [ERC-funded Digital Ludeme Project (DLP)](http://ludeme.eu/). This repository hosts the publicly available source code for Ludii. A precompiled build (Ludii.JAR) can be downloaded from [Ludii's downloads page](https://ludii.games/download.php).

## Requirements

Working with Ludii's source code requires Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher.

## Getting Started

### Eclipse (recommended)
1. Clone (and optionally fork) this repository.
2. Import the whole `Ludii/` folder to your workspace.
3. To start the GUI, right click on `/Ludii/PlayerDesktop/src/app/StartDesktopApp` and launch it as a Java Application

Eclipse should recognise each folder as a separate project and automatically apply the `-parameters` compiler flag.

### IntelliJ IDEA
1. Clone (and optionally fork) this repository.
2. Import the whole `Ludii/` folder as an Eclipse project. We recommend following the [official instructions on importing Eclipse projects](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/import-project-from-eclipse-page-1.html). 
Make sure to import each capitalised folder (`AI/`, ..., `View Controller/`) as a separate module.
3. In `Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Compiler | Java Compiler`, under `Additional command line parameters`, type `-parameters`. 
4. To start the GUI, create a new run configuration under `Run | Edit Configurations | + | Application`.
   1. Set the module to `PlayerDesktop` and use java 1.8 or above.
   2. Set the main class to `app.StartDesktopApp`.
   3. **Change the working directory from `.../Ludii` to `.../Ludii/PlayerDesktop`**

Every time you want to run a class, edit the run configuration such that the working directory is `.../Ludii/%Module%/` as opposed to `.../Ludii/`.

### Other IDEs
1. Keep in mind that each capitalised folder is meant to be a different module/project.
2. The Core module needs to be compiled using the `-parameters` flag. It's also okay to compile all the modules with it.
3. When executing a main method, set the working directory to the class's module, not the Ludii folder or the file location. 
For example `StartDesktopApp` should have as working directory `.../Ludii/PlayerDesktop`.

## Build & Run
The main method to launch Ludii from your IDE is located in `/Ludii/PlayerDesktop/src/app/StartDesktopApp`. At this time we do not use any more sophisticated build tools (such as Maven) in our day-to-day programming with Ludii. There are some relatively simple Ant build scripts, but we only use these -- specifically, the `/Ludii/PlayerDesktop/build.xml` script -- for generating the releases published on the [Ludii downloads page](https://ludii.games/download.php).

## Other Resources

We have various other resources available at the following links:

- [Ludii Tutorials](https://ludiitutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): various tutorials on aspects ranging from game design (using Ludii's game description language) to programming with Ludii as a programmatic library. The source files for these tutorials are [also available on GitHub](https://github.com/Ludeme/LudiiTutorials).
- [Ludii Documentation](https://ludii.games/download.php): the Ludii downloads page provides links to additional documentation, such as the [Ludii User Guide](https://ludii.games/downloads/LudiiUserGuide.pdf), [Ludii Game Logic Guide](https://ludii.games/downloads/LudiiGameLogicGuide.pdf), [Ludii Language Reference](https://ludii.games/downloads/LudiiLanguageReference.pdf), and [DLP Database Guide](https://ludii.games/downloads/DLP_Database_Guide.pdf).
- [Ludii Example AI](https://github.com/Ludeme/LudiiExampleAI): an example project for implementing Java-based AIs that can play Ludii games.
- [Ludii Python AI](https://github.com/Ludeme/LudiiPythonAI): an example project for implementing Python-based AIs that can play Ludii games.
- [Ludii AI Competition](https://github.com/Ludeme/LudiiAICompetition): a supporting project for Ludii AI competitions.
- [Ludii AI](https://github.com/Ludeme/LudiiAI): a repository used to hold the source code of built-in Ludii AIs before the entirety of the project was open-sourced. This repository is now deprecated, since the source code is also included in this repo.

## Contributing Guidelines

While we of course cannot guarantee that we will accept every suggested change or contribution, in principle we welcome contributions and are excited to see what you come up with! Please send contributions on GitHub as [new Pull Requests](https://github.com/Ludeme/Ludii/pulls), and provide brief descriptions of what has changed and in what ways these changes improve Ludii (or other aspects of the repo, such as documentation). Please ensure that any new or changed code follows the same code style as the rest of the repository.

**Note**: pull requests should be used for *code* or *documentation* contributions, but **not** for *new games* (i.e., `.lud` files). We prefer that new games are [submitted through our forums](https://ludii.games/forums/forumdisplay.php?fid=23).

# LudiiRecommender

The main methods in the updated evaluation system can be found in EvalGames.java, which can be located in supplementary/experiments/eval/EvalGames.java.  I have also added a new metric named Systematicity, which can be found in metrics/designer/Systematicity.java.  The main methods that I have added are as follow (they are all commented, for further insight examine said comments):

getEvaluationScores - Simply evaluates a game.  Provides multiple input and output options, so simplifies internal use of the evaluation function.

defaultEvaluationFast - Quickly evaluates a game with some tested settings.

defaultEvaluationSlow - Evaluates a game with some tested settings more thoroughly.

loadDB - Loads two pre-built CSV files into memory for later use.

recommendScore - Recommends an evaluation score for a game based its' nearest neighbors - either BoardGameGeek scores or metric scores can be used to do this.  For this method, loadDB is necessary.
